			<param index="1" name="lobby_id" type="int" />
			<description>
				Gets emitted after creating a lobby and a game server. Creator automatically joins the lobby. 
				Provided that result is [Steam].Result.RESULT_OK, callback for this signal would be a good moment to assign the peer to [MultiplayerAPI] by calling multiplayer.set_multiplayer_peer().
